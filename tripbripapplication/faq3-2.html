<b>26. How much can I travel while my booking?</b><br><br>
Each booking comes with its minimum kilometer fare. Additional kilometer journey includes per kilometer fixed charges. For better understanding consider an example, I book a sedan vehicle for a day rent. Means this booking comes under minimum<b> 275 kms </b>journey fare. If I travel less than<b> 275 kms </b>then also I have to pay for <b>275 kms</b> fare. If I travel more than that then fixed amount of per kilometer is added in total fare. If I make booking for<b> 3 </b>day then booking comes along with minimum<b> 825 kms</b> fare. Visit our tariff page for more information.</b><br><br>
